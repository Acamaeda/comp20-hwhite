This Git repository contains most of the things I made for this web programming class.
My favorite assignment... that is a difficult question. I enjoyed filling the Boston area with poorly drawn pig heads in the second assignment, and the dynamic comic and captain's log were both cool little things. I definitely didn't enjoy Assignment 3, and struggled a lot on it, and it sort destroyed my energy for the rest of the semester, but I still think it was an important experience.  
I definitely understand a lot more about the whole web system than I did then. I'd probably need to do a bit more learning in order to get something more serious done, but it doesn't seem out of reach.
Learning and practicing using Git seems super important. I already used it for an assignment in Comp 40. The experience of Assignment 3 also helped me to realize that my approach to the class was wrong. I was still thinking of it as the "easy comp course", which wasn't the only reason I took this course, but the main reason I took it this semester alongside Comp 40 (which is actually not that bad honestly.)
I think I've had enough of web programming for a while. What I would want to delve into depends on what would be relevant to other projects I might do. (I don't actually have much in mind at the moment)
