Everything works, I didn't collaborate with anyone, and it only took about an hour. I kind of forgot to do any git pushes because most of it was just trial and error with the sizing.

Edit: Apparently none of the git pushes actually worked because I was doing it wrong. I eventually figured it out, though.
