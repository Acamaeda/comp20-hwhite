I got some of the testing done but I probably could have gone deeper and I had to resort to memes at the end because I waited too long to reach out to my partner because that's hard for me sometimes.
I met with my partner but I don't think there was much in the way of help anywhere.
I spent somewhere between 2 and 4 hours on the assignment probably?
